# Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS) Modeling and Simulation
This project simulates an Anti-Lock Braking System (ABS), a crucial component in modern vehicles for maintaining control and reducing stopping distance during braking. my model is basic and I used MATLAB/Simulink to create a dynamic simulation of the ABS, which adjusts brake pressure to prevent wheel lockup and enhance stability.

# Features
Mathematical Modeling: Formulates ABS dynamics with a quarter-vehicle model for effective braking force distribution and simple modeling.
Real-Time Simulation: Simulates vehicle braking, stopping distance, and wheel slip to visualize ABS performance.
Bang-Bang Control: Implements a Bang-Bang controller to regulate brake pressure based on slip ratest 
The Bang-Bang controller, also known as an on-off controller, is a simple control system that switches abruptly between two states, typically "on" and "off," to maintain a system around a desired target or setpoint. In an ABS (Anti-Lock Braking System), the Bang-Bang controller manages the brake pressure to prevent wheel lockup.

Parameter Flexibility: Allows tuning for various road conditions and vehicle parameters.

# Results
Simulation results show vehicle stopping behavior with and without ABS.
